"IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate" certification offered by IBM and hosted by Coursera, this specialisation has provided me with in-depth knowledge and practical skills in the field of machine learning.

This program consists of 6 courses which provided me with solid theoretical understanding and hands-on practice of the main algorithms, their applications, pros and cons of each algorithm related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Courses which I have Completed in this specialisation are:
- Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning
- Supervised Machine Learning: Regression
- Supervised Machine Learning: Classification
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
- Machine Learning Capstone

In the Machine Learning Capstone project, I was able to implement a recommender system project. The main goal of this project is to improve learnersâ€™ learning experience via helping them quickly find new interested courses and better paving their learning paths.

The tasks I performed:
- Collecting and understanding data
- Performing exploratory data analysis on online course enrollments datasets
- Extracting Bag of Words (BoW) features from course textual content
- Calculating course similarity using BoW features
- Building content-based recommender systems using various unsupervised learning algorithms, such as: Distance/Similarity measurements, K-means, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), etc.
- Building collaborative-filtering recommender systems using various supervised learning algorithms: K Nearest Neighbors, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Neural Networks, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, RandomForest, etc.
- Creating an insightful and informative slideshow and presenting it.

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks and Watson Studio

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, Keras, and TensorFlow.
